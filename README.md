# Automated-Model-Selection-and-Hyperparameter-Optimization-Using-Bayesian-Optimization-

# Overview

This project implements automated model selection and hyperparameter optimization using Bayesian Optimization. The goal is to enhance machine learning model performance by efficiently tuning hyperparameters, reducing computational costs compared to grid search and random search.

# Features

- Bayesian Optimization using Gaussian Processes

- Support for Multiple Models (e.g., RandomForest, SVM, XGBoost, etc.)

- Hyperparameter Search Space Definition

- Visualization of Optimization Progress

- Efficient and Adaptive Hyperparameter Tuning

# Technologies Used

Python

Scikit-learn

Scipy

Bayesian Optimization Libraries (e.g., scikit-optimize, bayesian-optimization)

Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization

Installation

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bayesian-optimization.git
cd bayesian-optimization

# Create a virtual environment (optional)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

Prepare your dataset

Ensure the dataset is in a suitable format (CSV, NumPy arrays, Pandas DataFrame, etc.).

Run the optimization script

python optimize.py

Modify search space and models

Edit config.py to define models and their respective hyperparameter search spaces.

View results

The script generates logs and visualization plots to assess optimization performance.

Example Code Snippet

from skopt import gp_minimize
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
import numpy as np

def objective(params):
    n_estimators, max_depth = params
    model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=int(n_estimators), max_depth=int(max_depth))
    return -np.mean(cross_val_score(model, X, y, cv=5, scoring='accuracy'))

space = [(10, 200), (1, 50)]  # Search space for n_estimators and max_depth
result = gp_minimize(objective, space, n_calls=30, random_state=42)
print("Best Parameters:", result.x)

# Results & Visualization

Optimization progress is plotted using matplotlib.

Performance comparisons between different models are visualized.

Logs include detailed evaluation metrics.

Future Improvements

Extend support for deep learning models.

Integrate with frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.

Implement parallelized optimization.
